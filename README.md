# MarketingAnalysis

Code Overview:

This code is designed for marketing A/B testing analysis. It helps marketing teams evaluate the success of different campaigns and strategies by focusing on conversion rates.

Key Steps:

Data Preparation: The code begins by ensuring the dataset is clean, with no missing values or duplicates.

Conversion Rate Calculation: It calculates the overall conversion rate, revealing what percentage of users took a desired action as a result of the campaign.

Group-wise Analysis: The code breaks down conversion rates by different test groups (e.g., 'Ads' and 'PSA') for comparison.

Statistical Testing: Statistical significance testing, using a Z-test, determines if there's a significant difference in conversion rates between groups.

Visualizations: Visuals are generated to help interpret results, making it easier to understand the statistical findings.

Conclusions and Recommendations:

Based on the analysis, the code draws conclusions about campaign success and offers recommendations for further investigations.

Future Work:

Suggestions for future work include causal analysis, cost-efficiency evaluation, and user retention analysis to enhance campaign strategies.

This code empowers marketing professionals to make informed decisions and optimize campaigns for better results.
